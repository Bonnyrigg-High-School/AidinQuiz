In order to play the quiz, you need to download all the files from this repository, then you must open the "Web App" folder in Visual Studio Code. You then need to install an extension called Live Server in order to actually open the html in your browser. Once it's installed, go to "index.html" and press the "Go Live" button on the bottom right, then the quiz should be playable.

Just do it.
